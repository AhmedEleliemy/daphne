# Contributing to the DAPHNE Prototype

*Thank you* for your interest in contributing to the DAPHNE Prototype.
This is a team-effort that can only be successful if many people contribute to it.

Below you find a couple of *guidelines* (rather than rules) for contributing.
Since the Prototype repository is still in an early stage, this document is also *likely to be extended* step by step.

-----

There are various **ways of contributing** including (but not limited to):
- implementation work
- writing test cases
- writing documentation
- reporting bugs or any other kind of issue
- contributing to discussions

We encourage **open communication** about the code through issues and comments here on GitLab.
That way, we can document the discussion, make it accessible to all partners, and avoid repetition in case someone else has the same question/comment.

### Contributing to the source code

We will track all open issues/tasks on GitLab.

If you would like to contribute and are **looking for a task** to work on, browse the [list of issues](https://gitlab.know-center.tugraz.at/daphne/prototype/-/issues).
If you are new to the prototype, you might want to watch out for the label ["good first issue"](https://gitlab.know-center.tugraz.at/daphne/prototype/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=good+first+issue).
Once you have selected an issue to work on, please assign yourself or leave a comment.
It should be explicit who is working on which issue to avoid duplicate work by different people.

Furthermore, you are invited to **create issues yourself**, e.g., for tasks you want to work on or problems you encountered.
This is also a good way to enable discussion on the topic.
Note that there is a set of labels that can be attached to your issue to clarify what it is about and to make it more easy to find.

To **work on an issue**, please fork the prototype repository, implement your changes in your fork, and make a *merge request* (aka pull request on GitHub) to integrate your changes into the original repository.
Your work on an issue may consist of several commits. 

**Code style** is a topic on its own.
We are going to define a code style soon.
Until then, please try to be consistent with the code that is already there.
